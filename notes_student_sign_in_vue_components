What should happen when Add button in NewStudentForm is pressed?

-The NewStudentForm component should emit message to parent
    - in this project, that's App.vue
-NewStudentForm's job is to show a form, get input, validate
    – it doesn't care what happens to the new student once it's created

-Parent component (App.vue) will keep list of students
-Parent component will provide list to StudentTable component

***Problem - we shouldn't modify props***
-Using v-model student.present changes data in the student array
-We should avoid this - bad practice to modify props
-Child components should not change data in their parents - they should only communicate via events
  "data down, events up"

***"Data down, events up" (week 10, slide 86)
-StudentTable receives students as a prop
-StudentTable diplays data in template
-When user checks checkbox (we want to remove the v-model) We want StudentTable to emit an event to parent
with student info, and state of checkbox- checked or unchecked.
-App.vue receives the event (ex. a specific student has arrived) and updates (modifies its data) student data
    *App.vue will:
        -find the student in the array,
        -update whether or not they are present

-App.vue doesn't have to do anything else as the data is reactive:
-Because student data is reactive, and bound to the student prop in StudentTable,
then info will flow back to StudentTable sees the updates, AND the template will then update.

***Rows as components: **

New file – src/components/StudentRow.vue

This is really useful if the rows are complex – one row can manage just one student's data

Example: social media app timeline/newsfeed
A status update might have text, image, links, like/upvote buttons
Each status update is one row in a list or table
Each status update can be a component

***video 6 notes:**
Listing events that are emitted:

As you add events to your components, you'll need to add

emits: ['student-arrived-or-left']
in both StudentTable and StudentRow to remove the warning in the console.
If you don't add this then your app will still work.

Binding the student.present to the checkboxes

Your input checkbox needs
v-bind:checked="student.present"
which somehow went missing in this video.

$event.srcElement.checked should also be $event.target.checked, as you wrote in the last video.

The input element will look like this, https://github.com/claraj/vue-week-3-student-sign-in/blob/4286ab2354bf1f8cbbd3873ae7ebb2917aa422da/src/components/StudentRow.vue#L5

****Notes in video 7:****

Listing events that are emitted:
As you add events to your components, you can to add
emits: ['student-arrived-or-left', 'delete-student']
in both StudentTable and StudentRow to remove the warning in the console.  If you don't add this then your app will still work. Code should look like this:

StudentRow: https://github.com/claraj/vue-week-3-student-sign-in/blob/4286ab2354bf1f8cbbd3873ae7ebb2917aa422da/src/components/StudentRow.vue#L16 and

StudentTable: https://github.com/claraj/vue-week-3-student-sign-in/blob/4286ab2354bf1f8cbbd3873ae7ebb2917aa422da/src/components/StudentTable.vue#L39

Binding the student.present to the checkboxes
Your input checkbox needs
v-bind:checked="student.present"

 And

$event.srcElement.checked should also be $event.target.checked, as you wrote in an earlier video

So, StudentRow will look like this https://github.com/claraj/vue-week-3-student-sign-in/blob/4286ab2354bf1f8cbbd3873ae7ebb2917aa422da/src/components/StudentRow.vue#L5
